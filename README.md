# OHI gh-pages branch


To build the website, run [`rmarkdown::render_site()`](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/rmarkdown_websites.html), which knits each Rmarkdown (*.Rmd) based on parameters in `_site.R` and `_site.yml` before pushing the files back to Github. 

The majority of this website architecture was coded by [Ben Best](https://github.com/bbest) with significant inputs from [Julie Lowndes](https://github.com/jules32).
