# README

Use these folder to organize and explore data for your OHI assessment. Edit this README file to describe the data you explore and how you process them. 

For example, you could include: 

- data source
- data url or website
- date accessed, contact information
- processing plan

It is best to script (for example, in the R programming language) as much as you can so that it is transparent and reproducible. 

The [OHI Manual R tutorials for OHI](http://ohi-science.org/manual/#appendix-5-r-tutorials-for-ohi) has instruction and resources about how to work with data in R.
