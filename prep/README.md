# README

Use the `prep/` folder to organize and explore data for your OHI assessment. 

It is best to script (for example, in the R programming language) as much as you can so that it is transparent and reproducible. 

The [OHI Manual R tutorials for OHI](http://ohi-science.org/manual/#appendix-5-r-tutorials-for-ohi) has instruction and resources about how to work with data in R.
